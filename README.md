This is actually my first attempt at a software stack for the 
 circuit python express gadget.
Using a helper script to preprocess some external sources for 
 shell beep scripts, it plays fun music on a CPX.

there's no need to include the source_beeps dir onto the CPX itself

obviously everything should have it's own deployment strategy

that isn't execing or importing
